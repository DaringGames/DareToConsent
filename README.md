**Shoeless Winkers** is a game of escalating dares that go as far as possible, but never too far!

**What to Expect**

 * **Solo & Pair Dares:** Take on challenges alone or with a partner, with each dare becoming more daring than the last
 * **Consent Cards:** Before two-person dares, players privately share their willingness to participate, ensuring full consent
 * **Escalating Dares:** The first dares start simple, but become more daring until your group reaches their limit
 * **Never too far:**Â Anyone can prevent dares that go to far

**How the Game Flows**

 * **Choose a theme:** Will you do creative dares? Humiliating dares? Food dares? There are 14 theme cards to choose from
 * **On your turn:** Complete a pair dare, do a solo dare, start a drink, or pass
 * **New Dares:** Once someone completes the highest dare, a new harder dare is proposed and voted on
 * **Find your limit:** Play ends when dares no longer escalate, and the player with the most points wins

Dive in and have fun! How far will your group go?


To play this game, you will need the following:
* [Custom game cards](https://github.com/DaringGames/ShoelessWinkers/tree/main/Cards). You paste them onto real game cards or onto blank game cards, or you can just print them double-sided. You should have:
  * 14 theme cards
  * 3 consent cards for each player, in different colors matching your game pieces. For 10 players you would have 30 consent cards, 3 in each color.
* A [dare list](https://github.com/DaringGames/ShoelessWinkers/blob/main/PDFs/Dare%20Sheet.pdf) for your group to write down their escalating dares.
* A [dare progress sheet](https://github.com/DaringGames/ShoelessWinkers/blob/main/PDFs/Dare%20Progress.pdf) for each player to track which dares they have completed, with whom, and their points earned.
* Writing utensils

Once you have everything, read [the instructions](https://github.com/DaringGames/ShoelessWinkers/blob/main/PDFs/InstructionsBooklet.pdf) and give the game a try. Please let us know your experience and suggestions!
