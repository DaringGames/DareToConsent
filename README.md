<h2>Would you play Spin-the-Bottle if it only chose people who WANT to kiss each other?</h2>

In **Dare to Consent**, you choose a two-person dare from the menu, then privately collect consent cards to see who might join you:

If you do the biggest dare on the menu, you get to choose the next even bigger dare, until your group reaches their limit.

**Backstory**

This game was inspired by a conversation with my children, in which they were telling me how they would improve various board games. I jokingly challenged them to improve spin-the-bottle, and they answered that they would improve it by banning it!

Upon reflection, I realized that there are a lot of things wrong with spin-the-bottle and similar games such as truth-or-dare. I wondered if it was possible to update these games to keep the excitement while losing the pressure. I challenged myself to make a dare game that values enthusiastic consent, and can be as tame or as exciting as the players want it to be. Dare to Consent is the result.
