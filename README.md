<h2>Would you play Spin-the-Bottle if it only chose people who WANT to kiss each other?</h2>

In **Dare to Consent**, you choose a two-person dare from the menu, then privately collect consent cards to see who might join you:

If you do the biggest dare on the menu, you get to choose the next even bigger dare. The dares keep escalating until your group reaches their limit.
