"Dare games" are games which push people's boundaries, and they are usually deeply problematic (perhaps because they were invented by middle schoolers). 
 * They often have poor consent dynamics, with people doing things because they feel pressured by others
 * Sometimes dares happen which could be physically dangerous or damage relationships
 * Dare games need a way to keep their premise (Giving people an excuse to try boundary-pushing activities and see others do them) while allowing people to smoothly opt out of things they don't want to do or see.

**Shoeless Winkers** is a board game of party dares for 3-16 players which attempts to improve these dymanics. The game is currently under construction, and early assets have been published here for play testing.

To play this game, you will need the following:
* [The game board](https://github.com/DaringGames/ShoelessWinkers/blob/main/Game%20Board/20x20GameBoard.png), which is designed to be printed on a [20x20 inch quad-fold game board](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07THLWG3G).
* A LOT of Interconnectable game pieces in multiple colors. Something like [this](https://www.temu.com/goods.html?goods_id=601099525129549) or [this](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/2251832777869544.html).
  * If you want to play with 10 players, you will need 10 colors, and at least 10 pieces in each color (so 10x10 = 100 total pieces minimum).
  * For 16 players at least 16 pieces of each of 16 different colors (at least 256 pieces).
  * Note that our attempts at ordering these interlocking pieces have resulted in lots of some colors and very few of others, so don't assume that you will receive an even number of each color. 
* Green, yellow, and red poker chips, like [these](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/2251832503659677.html) for keeping score (and voting). The number of green chips should be roughly 5 times the number of players. Yellow represents 5 and red represents 10, so you will need fewer of those colors.
* An opaque cloth bag, for secret voting, such as [this one](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256806296143911.html).
* [Custom game cards](https://github.com/DaringGames/ShoelessWinkers/tree/main/Cards). You can paste them onto real game cards, or onto blank game cards. You should have:
  * 2 build-up cards
  * 14 theme cards
  * 3 consent cards for each player, in different colors matching your game pieces. For 10 players you would have 30 consent cards, 3 in each color.
* A [dare sheet](https://github.com/DaringGames/ShoelessWinkers/blob/main/PDFs/Dare%20Sheet.pdf) for your group to write down their escalating dares.

Once you have everything, read [the instructions](https://github.com/DaringGames/ShoelessWinkers/blob/main/PDFs/Instructions%20sheet.pdf) and give the game a try. Please let us know your experience and suggestions!
