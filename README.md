**Shoeless Winkers** is a game of escalating dares that go as far as possible, but never too far!

**What to Expect**

 * **Solo & Pair Dares:** Take on challenges alone or with a partner, with each dare becoming more daring than the last.
 * **Consent Cards:** Before pair dares, players privately share their willingness to participate, ensuring everyone is comfortable.
 * **Escalating Dares:** The first dares start simple (taking off your shoes or winking flirtatiously) but become more daring until your group reaches their limit.

**How the Game Flows**

 * **Choose a theme:** Will you do creative dares? Humiliating dares? Food dares? There are 14 theme cards to choose from.
 * **On your turn:** Complete a pair dare, do a solo dare, start a drink, or pass.
 * **Rewards accumulate:** Less chosen options become more valuable each turn they are not chosen. 
 * **New Dares:** Once someone completes the highest dare, a new harder dare is proposed and voted on.
 * **Find your limit:** Play ends when dares no longer escalate, and the player with the most points wins.

Dive in and have fun! How far will your group go?


To play this game, you will need the following:
* [The game board](https://github.com/DaringGames/ShoelessWinkers/blob/main/Game%20Board/20x20GameBoard.png), which is designed to be printed on a [20x20 inch quad-fold game board](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07THLWG3G).
* A LOT of Interconnectable game pieces in multiple colors. Something like [this](https://www.temu.com/goods.html?goods_id=601099525129549) or [this](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/2251832777869544.html).
  * If you want to play with 10 players, you will need 10 colors, and at least 10 pieces in each color (so 10x10 = 100 total pieces minimum).
  * For 16 players at least 16 pieces of each of 16 different colors (at least 256 pieces).
  * Note that our attempts at ordering these interlocking pieces have resulted in lots of some colors and very few of others, so don't assume that you will receive an even number of each color. 
* Green, yellow, and red poker chips, like [these](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/2251832503659677.html) for keeping score (and voting). The number of green chips should be roughly 5 times the number of players. Yellow represents 5 and red represents 10, so you will need fewer of those colors.
* An opaque cloth bag, for secret voting, such as [this one](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256806296143911.html).
* [Custom game cards](https://github.com/DaringGames/ShoelessWinkers/tree/main/Cards). You can paste them onto real game cards, or onto blank game cards. You should have:
  * 2 build-up cards
  * 14 theme cards
  * 3 consent cards for each player, in different colors matching your game pieces. For 10 players you would have 30 consent cards, 3 in each color.
* A [dare sheet](https://github.com/DaringGames/ShoelessWinkers/blob/main/PDFs/Dare%20Sheet.pdf) for your group to write down their escalating dares.

Once you have everything, read [the instructions](https://github.com/DaringGames/ShoelessWinkers/blob/main/PDFs/Instructions%20sheet.pdf) and give the game a try. Please let us know your experience and suggestions!
