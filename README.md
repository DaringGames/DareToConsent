**Shoeless Winkers** is a game of escalating two-person dares that go as far as possible, but never too far!

**What to Expect**

 * **Two-person Dares:** Take on challenges with another player, with each dare more daring than the last
 * **Consent Cards:** Before each dare, players privately share their willingness to participate, ensuring full consent
 * **Escalating Dares:** The first dares start simple, but become more daring until your group reaches their limit
 * **Never too far:**Â Anyone can prevent dares that go to far

**How the Game Flows**

 * **Choose a theme:** Will you do creative dares? Humiliating dares? Food dares? There are 14 theme cards to choose from
 * **On your turn:** Choose a dare from the menu, and collect consent cards from other players to see who might join you
 * **New Dares:** Once someone completes the biggest dare, they choose the next dare, with each dare more daring than the last
 * **Who is the most daring?:** First player to 20 points is the winner
